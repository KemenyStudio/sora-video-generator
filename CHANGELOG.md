### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed pricing structure** - Prices are per second ($0.10, $0.30, $0.50), not per minute as previously displayed
- Updated cost calculation to multiply seconds directly instead of converting to minutes
- Fixed displayed pricing units from "/min" to "/sec" throughout the UI
- Removed unnecessary markup multiplier since this is a direct API passthrough
- Removed erroneous division by 2 in cost tracking and display
- Removed `--turbopack` flag from production build script (was causing 404 on Vercel)
- Removed `vercel.json` to allow Vercel auto-detection of Next.js configuration

### Added
- **Past Generations Grid**: Fetch and display all completed videos from OpenAI API in a responsive grid layout
- New API endpoint `/api/videos` to list videos from OpenAI with pagination support

- Hover effects with play icon overlay and darkened background on video thumbnails
- Loading state with spinner while fetching past videos
- Empty state when no videos are found

### Changed
- Videos now persist beyond local browser storage by fetching from OpenAI API
